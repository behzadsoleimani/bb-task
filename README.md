## React Blog App Template
This template equips you with a minimal yet powerful starting point for your React projects using Vite, TypeScript, Hot Module Replacement (HMR), and ESLint. It's designed to get you up and running with a solid development environment, enabling you to focus on building your application.

## Installation
Before diving into development, you'll need to install the project dependencies. You can do this by running one of the following commands in your terminal, depending on your package manager of choice:

### Using Yarn
```
yarn
```

### Using npm

```
npm install
```

## Running the Project
To start the development server and work on your project with live feedback, execute the following command:

```
yarn dev
```
This will launch the development server, allowing you to view your changes in real-time.

## Building for Production
When your project is ready to be deployed, you can create a production build by running:

```
yarn build
```
After the build process completes, you can preview your production build locally by serving the build directory:

```
npx serve build
```

## Testing
Ensure your application functions correctly by running your test suite with:

```
yarn test
```
This command will run all tests associated with the project and report the outcomes.

## Live Preview
